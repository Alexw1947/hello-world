Introduction

</h1>

<p> Thank you for visiting my website. I have created this site to challenge myself to learn more about data analysis and web design / development. I once heard that teaching a subject helps to develop your own understanding and therefore i have decided to try and collate all the tips and tricks i learn along the way, in a format which anyone should be able to follow.
</p>
<h3> Background </h3>
<p>First and formost, i'm a user of Mircrosoft excel. When i started my first 'proper' job out of University in 2014, I developed a desire to learn about this programme and how to get the most out of it. I was using excel (and still am) on a daily basis for all sorts of ad-hoc tasks without having any knowledge on what its capabilities were.
ability the solve problems at work using the new formlas which I had learnt. The satisfaction i got from problems solving using Excel lead me to start exploring coding. I'm currently learning the basics of HTML / CSS and will be documenting my learning via this website. I'll also be documents some of useful Excel tips which i have picked up of the last 2 years working.</P>
